Hello world.
This is my first blog post.
I work with computers, mostly software.
This blog will be a collection of work related rants.

## Work

Finding work is harder & easier than ever.
What I mean is on one end there is no shortage of work, but on the other end there is no shortage of people.

Prime reason for finding work is money.
Issue with working for someone is that the pay is not proportional to the work done.
However, I imagine that in the web3 world, decentralised protocols can be used to get paid one's true value.

Thus, I think it is worthwhile to pursue such a project, meanwhile though I plan on using traditional ways to earn or raise or make money.

This leads us to recognizing that work may be assigned by someone else or by yourself.
