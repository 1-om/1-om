# 👋, Hi, I'm om

This is my alias :genie_man: for crypto-related work.
I'm a blockchain-focused developer.
I’ve built smart contracts, Web3 integrations, and crypto-related tools.

### contracts be smart <sub>🤓</sub>

> **Its verifiable computation.**

Some code ran,\
needs to be proven?\
Put it on the blockchain.:massage:

```while(😴){💰++;}```

#### 🍳 skills

Blockchain-based contracts are written in various **domain-specific-languages**

Contract knowledge:

- [4.5/5] _ethereum_ (solidity)
- [3/5] bitcoin (script, simplicity/liquid, contractum/rgb, solidity/rootstock)
- [3/5] solana( rust, solidity/solang)
- [2/5] tezos (fi, LIGO, michelson)

Backend:
- [4.5/5] javascript frameworks, typescript sdk
- [3/5] rust sdk
- [4.5/5] blockchain frameworks (hardhat, foundry, anchor)

### its "decentralized" 🕵️‍♂️

so we can code a [few unique use-cases](https://1-om.github.io/blockchain-use-cases),

#### what is possible?

[a lot of crypto ideas](https://github.com/1-om/crypto-project-ideas)  
& then,
