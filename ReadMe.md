### smart contracts

> **Note** **Issa verifiable computation.**\

Some code ran,\
needs to be proven,\
put it on the blockchain.:massage:

```while(😴){💰++;}```

#### 📚 about this

Blockchain-based contracts are written in various **domain-specific-languages**\
(the domain being verifiable computing, as stated above).

I explore contracts on:\

- [4.5/5] _ethereum_(solidity)
- [3/5] tezos(fi, LIGO, michelson)
- [3/5] solana(rust, solidity/solang)
- [2/5] bitcoin(script, simplicity/liquid, contractum/rgb, solidity/rootstock)

### its "decentralized" 🕵️‍♂️

so we can code a [few unique use-cases](),
