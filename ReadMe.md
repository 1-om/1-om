## 👋, you found me.

This is my alias:genie_man: for writing smart contracts.   

**It is verifiable computation.**  
Some code ran, needs to be proven, put it on the blockchain.:massage:  
```while(😴){💰++;}```

#### 📚 about this
Smart contracts are written in various domain-specific-languages.  
(domain being verifiable computing, as stated above)  
Most popular platform  is _ethereum_.  
Its' dsl is <mark>solidity</mark>.  

Most of the repos here are that, but  
other blockchain stuff too,  
some functional programming dsls  
like those used on _tezos_(does this even exist? we'll see)  

### its "decentralized" 🕵️‍♂️ 

so we can code whatever we want,

#### what is possible?
